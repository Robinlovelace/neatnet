\title{Neat Network Simplification}
\usage{
neatnet(
  x,
  dist = 10,
  max_segment_factor = 2,
  final_min_factor = 3,
  simplify = FALSE,
  selective = TRUE,
  classify_dist = 2 * dist
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An sf object representing the network.}

\item{dist}{Buffer distance (half width of road).}

\item{max_segment_factor}{Multiplier for dist to determine max_segment_length (default 2).}

\item{final_min_factor}{Multiplier for dist to determine final_min_length (default 3).}

\item{simplify}{Logical; if TRUE, applies line simplification and a final smoothing/healing
pass to reduce waviness. Default FALSE.}

\item{selective}{Logical; if TRUE (default), only applies the buffer/skeletonization
algorithm to features classified as `parallel` or `parallel+complex` by
`neatnet_classify_groups()`.
Other features are passed through untouched. This preserves straight single
carriageway segments and can be faster.}

\item{classify_dist}{Distance (map units) used by the classification step to detect
near-parallel line pairs. Defaults to `2 * dist` (i.e., lines whose buffers
would overlap at the given `dist`).}
}
\value{
An sf object of the simplified network.
}
\description{
Simplifies a road network using a buffer-based skeletonization approach.
