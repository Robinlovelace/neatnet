\title{Classify line features into groups (prototype)}
\usage{
neatnet_classify_groups(
  x,
  dist,
  grid_size = dist/5,
  parallel_tol_deg = 20,
  min_parallel_lines = 2,
  complex_min_junctions = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An sf object (or sfc) containing LINESTRING/MULTILINESTRING geometries.}

\item{dist}{Buffer distance (map units). Used both for grouping and for
tolerance values in the topology check.}

\item{grid_size}{Precision grid size used before topology checks.
Defaults to `dist/5`.}

\item{parallel_tol_deg}{Maximum angular deviation (degrees) within a group to
be considered parallel. Default 20.}

\item{min_parallel_lines}{Minimum number of features in a group for it to be
considered parallel. Default 2.}

\item{complex_min_junctions}{Minimum number of features in a group that must
touch a high-degree junction node (degree >= 3, after noding) for the group
to be considered complex. Default 1.}
}
\value{
An sf object with the original geometries and added columns:
  `group_id`, `n_in_group`, `bearing_deg`, `feature_parallel`, `feature_complex`,
  `group_parallel`, `group_complex`, and `group_class`.
}
\description{
Prototype preprocessing that clusters input lines into groups and classifies
each group as `parallel`, `complex`, both, or `keep`.
}
\details{
Grouping is based on overlap of buffers of width `dist`.
Parallelism is detected by low orientation dispersion within a group.
Complexity is detected by the presence of high-degree junctions after noding.
